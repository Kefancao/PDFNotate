** Notes **
1. I choose to do the "***Copy-Cut-Paste***" Feature, the feature is complete with the appropriate menu items as well as keyboard shortcuts (cmd + C, cmd + V, cmd + X) for each respective operation.
2. Trying to load a invalid file that's not my application saving format will yield and error!
3. The line on the tools panel is listening to the events and changes to reflect the appropriate selected properties!
