** Notes **
1. I choose to do the "***Copy-Cut-Paste***" Feature, the feature is complete with the appropriate menu items as well as keyboard shortcuts (cmd + C, cmd + V, cmd + X) for each respective operation.
2. I tried to do resizing for the window, but failed at that, just thought I'd mention it to save you some time. I have disabled resizing for this reason :(.
3. The line on the tools panel is listening to the events and changes to reflect the appropriate selected properties!
