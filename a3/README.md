To help facilitate marking, I've added an option where you are able to 
spam bullets in order to beat all the aliens.


When the ship gets hit by a enemy bullet. A new ship is spawn 
in the same spot and remains invincible for 5 seconds and is able to 
move around freely while everything else becomes frozen; however, as soon as the ship opens fire, 
the game starts up and gameplay resumes. The freezing is dictated by 
the ship flashing.
