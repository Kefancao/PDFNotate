**Notes**
-  The changing orientation feature does not work 100% as it doesn't align properly; however you're still able 
    to zoom and everything is saved :) (maybe part marks? ;)

- I have reference code from the cs349 public repo. Located in Android/PanZoom. This is documented in the code as well.
